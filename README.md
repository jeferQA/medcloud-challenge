About Medcloud:

We make exams and medical data management more flexible, secure and effective by accelerating the transition from clinics and hospitals to the cloud.
The RIS and PACS systems have been practically the same for the past 25 years. Interoperability problems, high costs and a lack of understanding about the patient's access to his medical records.

These points defined limits for the doctor-patient relationship and barriers to radiology workflows. We are revolutionizing this through a Care Coordination based solution that improves workflows for providers and integrates doctors and patients for a better experience.

Since our foundation, almost 10 years ago, we have prioritized excellence in the management of health data, structuring workflows of health professionals, clinics, laboratories and hospitals for assertive and quality diagnostics.

We understand that behind each medical record there is a patient seeking to improve his health and the hope of family members for his well being. After all, we are all patients, and Medcloud's mission is to help you live longer and better. #PatientFirst

# Development challenge

Medcloud's Challenge for Quality Assurance

## Goal

- To list and test features and find bugs in [this](https://qa.medcloud.link) website. In this repo, there's a Service Requirements Specification (SRS) file that you can use as minimum requirements.

## Required

- You must write down all the features in the website;
- You must create automated tests for the features using [Selenium chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd);
- You must find and write down all the bugs that were placed in the website.

## What will be evaluated:

- Clean and organized code (naming, etc.)
- Knowledge of patterns
- Be consistent and know how to argue your choices
- Present solutions you master
- Architecture (structuring thought before writing)

According to the above criteria, we will evaluate your test in order to proceed to the technical interview. If you have not acceptably achieved what we are proposing above, we will not proceed with the process.

## Delivery

You MUST fork this repository to your own account and push you code to it. 
When you finish it, you must send a email to cv@medcloud.com.br with your curriculum and your fork.

Good luck! Any doubts, feel free to send an email to cv@medcloud.com.br.

## For the day of the technical interview and code review

On the date set by the recruiter, have your application running on your local machine to run the tests and to show us the points developed and possible questions. We will do a code review together with you as if you were already on our team, you will be able to explain what you thought, how you architected and how the project can evolve. Good luck!
